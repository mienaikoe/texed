Data Exploration of Texas Education Data

## Prerequisites

This project is build with Jupyter Notebook, a platform for data investigation using Python. To get started with Jupyter Notebook, follow this guide: https://realpython.com/jupyter-notebook-introduction/

You'll also need Python3 with Pandas and Matplotlib installed to run the notebooks.

## Main Code

The main code of my data exploration is in the file at `data/correlation-campcomp.ipynb`. Open it in Jupyter Notebook to walk step-by-step through my work. It's a bit of a mess, but feel free to email me at mienaikoe@gmail.com if you need help looking through it deeper.
